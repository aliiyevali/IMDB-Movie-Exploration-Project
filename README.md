Comprehensive Movie Analysis

Introduction

In this project, I will delve into the captivating world of movie analysis, offering insights into intriguing facts, addressing key questions, and elucidating the intricacies of our analytical approach.
Let's begin by outlining the foundational elements of our dataset. It has been meticulously curated through the scraping of data from three distinct websites, ensuring a diverse range of data types and information. This diversity is crucial, as it accommodates the multifaceted nature of movie analysis, catering to a variety of analytical objectives.
When I contemplate the world of cinema, we often think about genres, and rightly so. My primary focus will be on movie genres in visualization stage. However, my analytical journey encompasses an array of critical factors, including the movie's release year, actors, budget and profitability. All these elements will be employed in my comprehensive analysis, enabling me to glean valuable insights from this rich and multifarious dataset.


Part 1: Confidence Intervals

In the context of my analysis, I present a scenario involving a film director faced with a pivotal decision - whether to invest in a movie based on an exceptional plot. This director's dilemma lies in the uncertainty of whether the chosen plot will meet their expected objectives in terms of profit. 
To address this significant concern, I have strategically implemented the concept of confidence intervals. Specifically, I will consider a movie plot that prominently features the Adventure and Fantasy genres. The director is seeking answers to questions that revolve around the suitability of these genres. Does the plot require adjustments or perhaps a shift towards different genres? 
In my pursuit of addressing this critical inquiry, I shall embark on a practical analysis.
In this analysis, I commenced by plotting the data to assess its suitability for the implementation of confidence intervals.
